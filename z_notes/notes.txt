- resolve environment variables
- [x] when admin add product, need to appear on the screen right after (no refresh)
- product model: (id, name, price, image, description, category, quantity, isInStock? )
- redis? (for session and caching)
- IP access list for DB (right now it's everywhere but should change to specific IP address)
- Where to store product images? (MongoDB?)
- async => asyncHandler for routes? Why?
- colored message in terminal
- need to have confirmation message for each message (are you sure to delete?, etc.)
- use throw new error instead of console.log(error) why?
- error handing for each action (what if it doesn't do what is expected to do? e.g remove product but it doesn't)
