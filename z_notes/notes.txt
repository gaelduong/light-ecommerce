- resolve environment variables
- [x] when admin add product, need to appear on the screen right after (no refresh)
- product model: (id, name, price, image, description, category, quantity, isInStock? )
- redis? (for session and caching)
- IP access list for DB (right now it's everywhere but should change to specific IP address)
- Where to store product images? (MongoDB?)
- async => asyncHandler for routes? Why?
- colored message in terminal
- need to have confirmation message for each message (are you sure to delete?, etc.)
- use throw new error instead of console.log(error) why?
- error handing for each action (what if it doesn't do what is expected to do? e.g remove product but it doesn't)
- request headers for each get,post,put,delete requests?
- proptypes for each component?
- create jwt_access_token using node package 'crypto'
- jwt, refresh token? expire token?
- secure password with mongoose?
- where to store jwt? http only cookie?
- route to handle non existing path (404)
- in Login, Redirect to /admin if already logged in and in admin, redirect to login if not logged in


* 2 ways to access the admin page
1. access /admin route => check if contains valid jwt 
=> if yes, show Admin page
=> if no, redirect to /login

2. login with username and password => submit => server verify credentials with DB
=> if wrong credentials, reject
=> if correct, send back jwt + redirect to /admin


- apply promotion to category/individual products (select?)
- create new category
- drag products in admin
- sort products by ... 
- attributes with varying prices
- same logic for 2 routes: /products and /products_admin => need to refactor
- [x] add multiple images
- [x] fix get for fetching multiple images
- [x] delete multiple images
- edit for multiple images
- change to dynamic number of images instead of 2
- display images in ProductsDisplay? (show 1 + more?)
- need to find a way to ensure consistency between the image files and image paths in db
- extract imagesInput into component
